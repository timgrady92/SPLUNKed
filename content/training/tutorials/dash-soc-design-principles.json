        "body": "<p>A well-designed dashboard saves analysts time and reduces cognitive load. A poorly designed dashboard becomes shelfware that nobody trusts. The difference isn't about making things pretty—it's about making information <strong>actionable</strong>.</p><p>Consider the difference between a dashboard that answers \"What's happening?\" in 3 seconds versus one that requires 30 seconds of interpretation. Over a 12-hour shift, that difference translates to hours of lost productivity.</p>"

        "body": "<p>Every SOC dashboard falls into one of three categories, each with distinct design requirements:</p><h4>1. Monitoring Dashboards</h4><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Continuous situational awareness during shifts</p><p><strong>Design priorities:</strong></p><ul><li>Real-time or near-real-time data (< 5 minute refresh)</li><li>Large, visible panels for wall-mounted displays</li><li>Clear visual indicators (green/yellow/red)</li><li>Minimal interaction required</li></ul><p><strong>Examples:</strong> Alert queue status, system health, active incident counts</p><h4>2. Investigation Dashboards</h4><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Support active incident analysis and triage</p><p><strong>Design priorities:</strong></p><ul><li>Rich filtering and time selection</li><li>Drilldown capabilities to raw events</li><li>Multiple data perspectives (timeline, table, summary)</li><li>Quick pivot between related data</li></ul><p><strong>Examples:</strong> User activity investigator, host forensics, network flow analyzer</p><h4>3. Reporting Dashboards</h4><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Communicate metrics to stakeholders and leadership</p><p><strong>Design priorities:</strong></p><ul><li>Longer time ranges (weekly, monthly, quarterly)</li><li>Trend comparisons and change indicators</li><li>Clean, presentation-ready layouts</li><li>Export and scheduling capabilities</li></ul><p><strong>Examples:</strong> Weekly SOC metrics, compliance reports, executive summaries</p>"

This rule forces you to prioritize:</p><h4>Apply the Rule</h4><ol><li><strong>Identify the single most important metric</strong> - Make it the largest, most prominent element</li><li><strong>Use visual hierarchy</strong> - Size, position, and color should guide the eye</li><li><strong>Eliminate noise</strong> - Remove anything that doesn't support quick understanding</li></ol><h4>Visual Hierarchy Principles</h4><ul><li><strong>Top-left position</strong> gets read first (in left-to-right cultures)</li><li><strong>Larger panels</strong> communicate higher importance</li><li><strong>Color should mean something</strong> - Red for bad, green for good, consistently</li><li><strong>White space</strong> separates logical groups and reduces visual clutter</li></ul>"
